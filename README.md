# projecteuler
An attempt at some project Euler math probems: http://projecteuler.com

Focus here is on simplicity/readability of code, and not speed optimisation. 

Download and run with Visual Studio and IIS to browse as a website, or simply browse the questions from here: https://github.com/jaybong/projecteuler/tree/master/questions

The site is available to browse here: http://muddlingthroughmath.azurewebsites.net however be aware that this is running the actual computations, so some non optimized questions will take a while for the page to load.
